# pricing-plans

Sup homiesssss
I made this project using my course as a base.
The teacher of the course sent us this "Pricing Plans" project, that we should create the CSS code from scratch. I used the flexbox to manipulate the Pricing boxes, and i'm happy with the result. I guess it's the first project that i was happy to see my progress in this new world of coding.
And also i'm happy to share with you all!
Hope you like it!
